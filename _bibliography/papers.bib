  abstract={Deep networks are well-known to be fragile to adversarial attacks, and adversarial training is one of the most popular methods used to train a robust model. To take advantage of unlabeled data, recent works have applied adversarial training to contrastive learning (Adversarial Contrastive Learning; ACL for short) and obtain promising robust performance. However, the theory of ACL is not well understood. To fill this gap, we leverage the Rademacher omplexity to analyze the generalization performance of ACL, with a particular focus on linear models and multi-layer neural networks under $\ell_p$ attack ($pâ‰¥1$). Our theory shows that the average adversarial risk of the downstream tasks can be upper bounded by the adversarial unsupervised risk of the upstream task. The experimental results validate our theory.},

  abstract={Although deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved great success, their applications in safety-critical areas are hindered due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Some recent works have accordingly proposed to enhance the robustness of DNN from a dynamic system perspective. Following this line of inquiry, and inspired by the asymptotic stability of the general nonautonomous dynamical system, we propose to make each clean instance be the asymptotically stable equilibrium points of a slowly time-varying system in order to defend against adversarial attacks. We present a theoretical guarantee that if a clean instance is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point and the adversarial instance is in the neighborhood of this point, the asymptotic stability will reduce the adversarial noise to bring the adversarial instance close to the clean instance. Motivated by our theoretical results, we go on to propose a nonautonomous neural ordinary differential equation (ASODE) and place constraints on its corresponding linear time-variant system to make all clean instances act as its asymptotically stable equilibrium points. Our analysis suggests that the constraints can be converted to regularizers in implementation. The experimental results show that ASODE improves robustness against adversarial attacks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
